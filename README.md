# The Philippinesâ€™ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): A Dashboard
The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a set of global objectives established by the United Nations (UN) to address various social, economic, and environmental challenges faced by our world today. These goals were launched in 2015 as a successor to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and provide a holistic framework to achieve sustainable development by the year 2030 (United Nations Development Programme, n.d.).

### Motivation behind the creation of the dashboard

### Target Users of the dashboard
Policymakers play a crucial role in the development and progress of a nation. They are responsible for making decisions that shape the future of their country. In the created dashboard for the Philippines' Progress on SDGs, policymakers serve as intermediate users of the dashboard.
Interactive visualizations provide policymakers with a comprehensive overview of the progress made on various SDGs. These visualizations present data in an easily understandable format, allowing policymakers to assess the effectiveness of their policies and identify areas that require improvement. By analyzing these visualizations, policymakers can make informed decisions and develop strategies to address gaps in achieving SDGs.
Moreover, interactive visualizations facilitate transparency and accountability. Policymakers can use these tools to communicate progress to stakeholders, including citizens and international organizations. By sharing this information openly, policymakers can foster trust and collaboration among different sectors towards achieving SDGs.
Furthermore, interactive visualizations enable policymakers to track progress over time. They can compare current data with historical trends, enabling them to evaluate whether their policies have been successful in driving positive change. This information is invaluable for policymaking as it allows them to adjust strategies accordingly and allocate resources effectively.
