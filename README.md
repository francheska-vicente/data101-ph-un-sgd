 # The Philippinesâ€™ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): A Dashboard
The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a set of global objectives established by the United Nations (UN) to address various social, economic, and environmental challenges faced by our world today. These goals were launched in 2015 as a successor to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and provide a holistic framework to achieve sustainable development by the year 2030 (United Nations Development Programme, n.d.).

### Motivation behind the creation of the dashboard
In the context of the Philippines, there seems to be a lack of visualization of the progress made toward these goals.

One reason for this lack of visualization is the limited availability and accessibility of data. While some government agencies and international organizations provide periodic reports on SDG progress in the country, these reports often lack detailed information or are not widely disseminated to the public. As a result, many Filipinos remain unaware of the specific targets set under each goal and how their country is faring in achieving them. Another factor contributing to this lack of visualization is the absence of effective communication strategies. The government and other stakeholders need to invest more in raising awareness about the SDGs through various channels such as media campaigns, community engagement activities, and educational programs. By doing so, they can help citizens understand how their individual actions contribute to national progress toward these goals.

It is crucial to have a clear understanding of the progress made toward achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs) especially since the world continues to progress in a fast-paced manner. One effective way to comprehend this progress is through visualization. By creating visual representations, such as charts, graphs, and maps, we can easily grasp complex data and trends. This holds true for assessing the advancement of the Philippines in achieving SDGs.

Visualizations serve as powerful tools for presenting complex information in a clear and engaging manner, enabling the target users to gain a deeper understanding of the subject matter. **By visually representing the progress made by the Philippines on each SDG, individuals can easily comprehend the significance and impact of these goals. This heightened awareness can then spur discussions, drive engagement, and mobilize people towards taking concrete actions to contribute to the attainment of the SDGs.** 

Additionally, an interactive visualization can foster accountability and transparency in the context of SDG implementation. Through the provision of accessible and up-to-date information, citizens can actively monitor the progress of the Philippines on each goal. This transparency empowers individuals to hold their government accountable and advocate for more effective policies and strategies. Similarly, it enables organizations and stakeholders involved in SDG implementation to evaluate their efforts and identify areas for improvement. By promoting transparency and accountability, an interactive visualization can trigger a sense of collective responsibility and encourage collaborative action towards achieving the SDGs.

### Target Users of the dashboard
**Policymakers play a crucial role in the development and progress of a nation.** They are responsible for making decisions that shape the future of their country. In the created dashboard for the Philippines' Progress on SDGs, policymakers serve as intermediate users of the dashboard.
Interactive visualizations provide policymakers with a comprehensive overview of the progress made on various SDGs. These visualizations present data in an easily understandable format, allowing policymakers to assess the effectiveness of their policies and identify areas that require improvement. By analyzing these visualizations, policymakers can make informed decisions and develop strategies to address gaps in achieving SDGs.
Moreover, interactive visualizations facilitate transparency and accountability. Policymakers can use these tools to communicate progress to stakeholders, including citizens and international organizations. By sharing this information openly, policymakers can foster trust and collaboration among different sectors towards achieving SDGs.
Furthermore, interactive visualizations enable policymakers to track progress over time. They can compare current data with historical trends, enabling them to evaluate whether their policies have been successful in driving positive change. This information is invaluable for policymaking as it allows them to adjust strategies accordingly and allocate resources effectively.

## How to set up and run the project locally
1. In your File Explorer, navigate to the project folder containing **main.ipynb**. 
2. Open the file **.mapbox_token** using a Notepad, and paste your mapbox token. Save your changes.
3. Launch `Jupyter Notebook` or `Jupyter Lab`.
4. Navigate to the project folder containing **main.ipynb**. 
5. Then, in the **Final** folder, open the **2-Geospatial_v3.ipynb**.
6. In the **2-Geospatial_v3.ipynb**, click **Restart and Run All**, this would create the geospatial files needed to run the application.
7. Once the notebook is done executing, open your `Command Prompt` or `Terminal` and navigate it to the folder containing **app.py**.
8. Run the dashboard using the command **python app.py**.
9. Wait for the dashboard to complete initialization. Once done, on your browser, go to `http://127.0.0.1:8080/`.
